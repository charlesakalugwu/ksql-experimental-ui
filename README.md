# ![KSQL rocket](ksq-lrocket.png) KSQL Experimental UI


This project is an experimental UI for [KSQL](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql).  The goal is to provide a simple visual wrapper for KSQL’s CLI.  The experimental UI is meant to be used for local development, testing and demoing KSQL. 
 
 >If you want to use KSQL in production environments, we recommend the use of KSQL’s CLI.


The KSQL Experimental UI release artifact is pulled from github/release into KSQL as part of the packaging process.
